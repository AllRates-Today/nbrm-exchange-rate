**Official National Bank of North Macedonia (North Macedonia) daily exchange rates for Node.js and TypeScript. The published central bank rates behind tax filings, customs valuations, audits, and compliant invoicing — not market estimates, but the numbers National Bank of North Macedonia itself prints, every business day.**

## 🚀 Why this client?

- 🏛️ **Official published rates** — National Bank of North Macedonia's own table, with the publisher's own `rate_date` on every response
- 📅 **History back to 1993** — point-in-time tables and daily series for any past date
- 🔀 **Published vs derived, always flagged** — computed inverse/cross pairs carry `derived: true`, never mixed with official prints
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — pure ESM + CJS over global `fetch`; Node 18+, Bun, Deno, and edge runtimes
- 🔷 **Type-safe** — full TypeScript definitions shipped with the package
- 🧾 **Compliance-grade metadata** — `rate_type`, publication date, and source disclaimer on every response

> **Official rate, not mid-market:** every value here is a number National Bank of North Macedonia itself published, fixed once printed and carrying the central bank's own `rate_date` — what filings and audits require. Need the live interbank midpoint for pricing or display instead? Use the [mid-market API](https://allratestoday.com/docs/) or [`@allratestoday/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allratestoday/sdk). The two can diverge by several percent.

## ⚡ Try it without a key

The latest National Bank of North Macedonia table is also served keyless, CORS-open and edge-cached, for evaluation, embeds and AI agents:

```bash
curl "https://allratestoday.com/api/open/central-bank/nbrm?source=EUR&target=MKD"
```

```js
const r = await fetch('https://allratestoday.com/api/open/central-bank/nbrm').then((x) => x.json());
console.log(r.rate_date, r.rates.length); // the central bank's latest published table, no key
```

The open endpoint serves the *latest* table only and asks for a visible attribution link. The client below uses the keyed API, which adds point-in-time tables, history, and CSV/XML/Excel output.

---

### Latest pair rate

Free plan and up. Pairs the central bank does not print directly are resolved from its table and flagged (see *Published vs derived rates* below).

```js
const pair = await getRate('EUR', 'MKD', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'nbrm',
  name: 'National Bank of North Macedonia',
  rate_date: '2026-09-09',   // National Bank of North Macedonia's own publication date
  source: 'EUR',
  target: 'MKD',
  rate: 61.495,
  rate_type: 'reference',
  derived: false,
  method: 'published',
  disclaimer: 'Official rates as published by the named central bank. On weekends/holidays the most recent published rate_date is returned.'
}
```

### Full published table

Free plan and up. The complete table for the latest publication date.

```js
import { getLatestRates } from 'nbrm-exchange-rate';

const table = await getLatestRates({ apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
console.log(table.rate_date, table.rates.length);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'nbrm',
  name: 'National Bank of North Macedonia',
  rate_date: '2026-09-09',
  rates: [
    { "base": "EUR", "quote": "MKD", "type": "reference", "value": 61.495 },
    { "base": "EUR", "quote": "MKD", "type": "sell", "value": 61.8025 },
    { "base": "EUR", "quote": "MKD", "type": "buy", "value": 61.1875 },
    // … the rest of the published table (31 currencies vs MKD)
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Table for a date

Paid plans. The official table for any date since 1993 — weekends and holidays return the most recent published date, flagged via `published_on_requested_date`, which is exactly the in-force rate a filing needs.

```js
import { getRatesForDate } from 'nbrm-exchange-rate';

const day = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
// Optionally narrow to one pair:
const one = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...', source: 'EUR', target: 'MKD' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'nbrm',
  requested_date: '2026-06-30',
  rate_date: '2026-06-30',                // the date actually published
  published_on_requested_date: true,      // false when a weekend/holiday fell back
  rates: [ /* the full table for that date */ ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Daily time series

Paid plans. One resolved rate per publication date — ready for charting, revaluation runs, or audit workpapers.

```js
import { getHistory } from 'nbrm-exchange-rate';

const series = await getHistory(
  { source: 'EUR', target: 'MKD', from: '2026-01-01', to: '2026-09-09' },
  { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }
);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'nbrm',
  source: 'EUR',
  target: 'MKD',
  from: '2026-01-01',
  to: '2026-09-09',
  count: 152,
  rates: [
    // one entry per publication date
    { date: '2026-09-09', rate: 61.495, rate_type: 'reference', derived: false, method: 'published' },
    // …
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

Pass `{ symbol: 'EUR' }` instead of `source`/`target` to get the raw published rows for one currency (all rate types, no pair resolution).

## 🏛️ Source

The National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia publishes a daily exchange rate list — middle, buying and selling rates for 31 currencies against the denar, which has tracked the euro in a tight managed band for two decades. The series runs unbroken since 1993, the denar's first year as a full currency.

- Publisher's own page: [Exchange rate list](https://www.nbrm.mk/kursna_lista-en.nspx) · [www.nbrm.mk](https://www.nbrm.mk)
- Publication: every business day; the exact schedule, freshness status and any current delay are on the [National Bank of North Macedonia rates page](https://allratestoday.com/central-bank-rates-api/nbrm/)
- Values are stored unmodified, with the publisher's own `rate_date` on every row — see the [methodology](https://allratestoday.com/official-rates-methodology/)

## 🧭 Reading the numbers

- `value` is always **quote currency per 1 unit of base currency** (`base: "EUR", quote: "USD", value: 1.15` means 1 EUR = 1.15 USD).
- National Bank of North Macedonia quotes **MKD per 1 unit of foreign currency** (e.g. `base: "USD", quote: "MKD"` means MKD per one US dollar).
- Need the other way round? Ask `getRate(target, source)` and the API inverts or crosses for you, flagged `derived: true` — never divide a published rate yourself in a compliance workflow.
- `rate_type` tells you which of the central bank's series a row belongs to (`reference` here); some publishers print buy/sell or several fixings for the same pair.

## 🧩 ERP & accounting systems

Loading the official National Bank of North Macedonia rate into an accounting system is a supported workflow, not a hack. Step-by-step guides with the direction each system expects:

- [Xero](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/xero/) · [QuickBooks Online](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/quickbooks/) · [SAP S/4HANA and ECC](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/sap/) · [Odoo](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/odoo/)

The same keyed endpoints return `?format=csv`, `?format=xml` and `?format=xlsx`, and accept the key as `?api_key=` on the URL for importers that cannot send headers:

```bash
curl "https://allratestoday.com/api/v1/central-bank/nbrm/latest?format=xml&api_key=art_live_..."
```

## ⚖️ Published vs derived rates

If National Bank of North Macedonia does not print a pair directly, the API resolves it from the central bank's own table and says so — official and computed values are never confused:

| `method` | `derived` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `published` | `false` | The central bank printed this pair directly |
| `inverse` | `true` | Computed as 1 ÷ the published opposite direction |
| `cross` | `true` | Computed via MKD from two published rates |

## 🛡️ Error handling

Errors are thrown as `Error` with `status` (HTTP code) and `body` (the API's JSON error) attached:

```js
try {
  const pair = await getRate('EUR', 'XXX', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // human-readable reason
  console.log(err.status);  // e.g. 404
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| — | Missing `apiKey` (thrown before any request) |
| `400` | Malformed date or parameters |
| `401` | Invalid API key |
| `403` | Endpoint needs a [paid plan](https://allratestoday.com/pricing/) (historical dates & series) |
| `404` | Pair or date range not covered by National Bank of North Macedonia |
| `429` | Monthly quota exceeded |

## 🔷 TypeScript

Full definitions ship with the package — no `@types` install:

```ts
import type { LatestRates, PairRate, DatedRates, RateEntry, HistoryQuery, RequestOptions } from 'nbrm-exchange-rate';
```

## 📦 CommonJS

```javascript
const { getRate } = require('nbrm-exchange-rate');

getRate('EUR', 'MKD', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }).then((pair) => console.log(pair.rate));
```

## 💡 Quota tips

- Rates change once per business day — cache the published table locally and a small monthly quota goes a long way.
- Every request counts toward your AllRatesToday quota, shared across all AllRatesToday endpoints on your key.
